## Product Description

'Superiority in Calculations' is a unique forex software designed to perform advanced calculations and analysis for multiple currency pairs. It aims to provide traders with accurate trend predictions and assist in making informed trading decisions.

### Features

- Customizable input parameters for user preferences
- Calculation of trend for each currency pair
- Calculation of lot size based on risk percentage
- Calculation of stop loss and take profit prices
- Execution of buy or sell trades based on calculated trends

### How It Works

The code uses the MQL5 programming language and is designed to run on the MetaTrader 5 platform. It consists of several functions that perform different calculations and trading operations.

1. Input Parameters: The user can customize the following parameters:
   - StopLoss: The desired stop loss in pips.
   - TakeProfit: The desired take profit in pips.
   - RiskPercentage: The risk percentage per trade.

2. Initialization: The `OnInit()` function initializes the expert advisor by setting all currency pairs to be used initially.

3. Start Function: The `OnStart()` function is the main function that executes the trading logic. It loops through all the currency pairs and performs the following steps for each pair:
   - Check if the currency pair should be used based on the user's choice.
   - Calculate the trend for the currency pair using the `CalculateTrend()` function.
   - Make trading decisions based on the calculated trend:
     - If the trend is positive, execute a buy trade using the `ExecuteBuyTrade()` function.
     - If the trend is negative, execute a sell trade using the `ExecuteSellTrade()` function.

4. Calculation Functions: Several functions are implemented to calculate different parameters:
   - `CalculateTrend()`: This function implements the trend calculation algorithm for a given currency pair.
   - `CalculateLotSize()`: This function calculates the lot size based on the risk percentage and the account balance.
   - `CalculateStopLossPrice()`: This function calculates the stop loss price for a given currency pair and stop loss value.
   - `CalculateTakeProfitPrice()`: This function calculates the take profit price for a given currency pair and take profit value.

5. Execution Functions: The `ExecuteBuyTrade()` and `ExecuteSellTrade()` functions contain the logic to execute buy and sell trades, respectively. They place the trades with the specified parameters such as lot size, stop loss price, and take profit price.
